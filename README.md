## Linked AVL Tree ##

### Description ##
This project aims to implement the AVL Tree algorithm, using linked nodes to perform the 
necessary operations on modifying, organizing, and searching the AVL Tree.

This is constructed so as to be used by any sortable variable via the generic T data type

### Languages Used ###
 - Java SE 8
 
### How to use ###
The LinkedAVLTreeTest class will be used as the main method entry point from which the 
algorithm can be tested with a set of varying data types, currently it will be tested with integers.
 
Output will be presented to the console window
